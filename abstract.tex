Multidimensional Continued Fraction Algorithms are generalizations of the Euclid
algorithm and find iteratively the gcd of two or more numbers. They are defined
as linear applications on some cone of $\mathbb{R}^d$. In these Cheat Sheets, we
consider $3$-dimensional continued fraction algorithms that acts symmetrically
on the positive cone $\mathbb{R}^d_+$. We include well-known and old ones
(Poincar\'e, Brun, Selmer, Fully Subtractive) and new ones
(Arnoux-Rauzy-Poincar\'e, Reverse, Cassaigne). 

For each algorithm, a cheat sheet gathers a handful of informations most of them
generated with the open source software Sage with the optional Sage package
\texttt{slabbe-0.2.spkg}. The information includes the $n$-cylinders, density
function of an absolutely continuous invariant measure, domain of the natural
extension, lyapunov exponents as well as some aspects regarding combinatorics on
words and digital geometry.

The document ends with a table of comparison of Lyapunov exponents and gives the
code allowing to reproduce any of the results or figures appearing in these
cheat sheets.
